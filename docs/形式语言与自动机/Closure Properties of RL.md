# Closure Properties of Regular Languages

## Closure Properties

A closure property of a class of languages says that given languages in the class, the operation on the languages results in a language that is also in the class. For example, the class of regular languages is closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene star operations.

## Closure of Regular Languages

### Closure under Union, Concatenation, and Kleene Star

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular languages, so is $L_1 \cup L_2$.

**Proof** Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be regular expressions for $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. Then, $R_1 + R_2$ is a regular expression for $L_1 \cup L_2$. Therefore, $L_1 \cup L_2$ is a regular language. (Regular languages are equivalent to languages that can be generated by regular expressions.)

We can also prove **closure under concatenation and Kleene star** operations in a similar way.

### Closure under Intersection, Difference, and Complement

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular languages, so is $L_1 \cap L_2$.

**Proof** Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be DFAs for $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. Then, we can construct a DFA $M$ for $L_1 \cap L_2$ by taking the Cartesian product of the states of $M_1$ and $M_2$. We make the final state of $M$ the pairs consisting of final states of **both** $M_1$ and $M_2$.

We can also prove **closure under difference and complement** operation in a similar way.

### Closure under Reversal

If $L$ is a regular language, so is $L^R$.

**Proof** Let $R$ be a regular expression for $L$. We can define the reverse of $R$ as follows:

- **Basis**: If $E$ is a symbol, $\varepsilon$, or $\emptyset$, then $E^R = E$.
- **Induction**: 
  - If $E$ is $F+G$, then $E^R = F^R + G^R$.
  - If $E$ is $FG$, then $E^R = G^R F^R$.
  - If $E$ is $F^*$, then $E^R = (F^R)^*$.

Therefore, $R^R$ is a regular expression for $L^R$. Hence, $L^R$ is a regular language.

### Closure under Homomorphism

A homomorphism on an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a function $h: \Sigma \to \Delta^*$, where $\Delta$ is another alphabet. A homomorphism $h$ can be extended to strings in $\Sigma^*$ as follows: $h(w) = h(w_1)h(w_2)\cdots h(w_n)$, where $w = w_1w_2\cdots w_n$. In this situlation, $h$ is a homomorphism from $\Sigma^*$ to $\Delta^*$. 

If $L$ is a regular language, so is $h(L)$. $h(L) = \{h(w) \mid w \in L\}$.

**Proof** Let $R$ be a regular expression for $L$. We can define a regular expression $S$ for $h(L)$ as follows:

- **Basis**: If $E$ is a symbol, $\varepsilon$, or $\emptyset$, then $S = h(E)$.
- **Induction**: 
  - If $E$ is $F+G$, then $S = h(F) + h(G)$.
  - If $E$ is $FG$, then $S = h(F)h(G)$.
  - If $E$ is $F^*$, then $S = (h(F))^*$.

Therefore, $S$ is a regular expression for $h(L)$. Hence, $h(L)$ is a regular language.

### Closure under Inverse Homomorphism

Give homomorphism $h: \Sigma^* \to \Delta^*$ and $L \subseteq \Delta^*$, the inverse homomorphism $h^{-1}: \Delta^* \to \Sigma^*$ is defined as follows: $h^{-1}(a) = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid h(w)\in L\}$. In other words, $h^{-1}(L)$ consists of strings whose homomorphic images are in $L$.

    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: gray;">Inverse Homomorphism</p>
  </div>

For example, let $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ and $\Delta = \{0, 1\}$. Let $h(a) = 01$, $h(b) = 10$, and $L = (00\cup 1)^*$. Then, $h^{-1}(1001) = \{ba\}$, $h^{-1}(L) = (ba)^*$.

If $L$ is a regular language, so is $h^{-1}(L)$.
